1. Clone this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Open solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Open file `FramePrinter.cs`
4. Implement method `Print(string[] strings)` so that it takes input `strings` parameter and print them in console each to separate line in a frame. 
5. Run with `CTRL+F5` to test it.
6. If all tests are passed, commit&sync your repository.
7. Send link to your repository for Lab Master (in #slack) to check it.

Example `["Hello", "World", "in", "a", "frame"]` will print this:
````
*********  
* Hello *

* in    *  
* a     *  
* frame *  
*********  
````
